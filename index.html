        <article>
            <p>Hey, I enjoy programming, cooking, and some other things but mostly the first two are shared here.</p>
            <h2>nickname</h2>
            <p>The nickname <em>supakeen</em> is a combination of two names: Commander Keen and Supaplex. Both were games I played a bunch when I was tiny.</p>
            <h2>index</h2>
            <p>These are the main parts of this website, there's roughly three that I keep updated. For a full index you might enjoy the <a href="/sitemap.html">sitemap</a> which has all the pages on this website on it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./weblog">weblog</a> about tech and this website</li>
                <li><a href="./notes">notes</a> on programming, languages, and more</li>
                <li><a href="./recipes">recipes</a> for you to cook</li>
                <li><a href="./public.key">gpg key</a> for <a href="mailto:cmdr@supakeen.com">cmdr@supakeen.com</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>projects</h2>
            <p>Some of my open source projects both in software and hardware. I program mostly in the Python programming language, C, bash, and others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./project/gb">gb</a> a gopher server in Python</li>
                <li><a href="./project/pinnwand">pinnwand</a> a pastebin in Python</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>external</h2>
            <p>I maintain a bunch of external accounts as well, these are my most used thought that doesn't mean I'm particularly active on them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://twitter.com/supakeen">twitter</a> slightly inactive sillyness</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/supakeen">github</a> my code</li>
                <li><a href="https://keybase.io/supakeen">keybase</a> (contains more)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>other protocols</h2>
            <p>This site is available in a variety of other protocols as well. Mostly older ones because I enjoy implementing them.</p>
            <h3>ftp</h3>
            <p>Most of the content of this website is also available through ftp at <a href="ftp://supakeen.com">ftp://supakeen.com</a>.</p>
            <h3>gopher</h3>
            <p>Most of the content of this website is also available through gopher at <a href="gopher://supakeen.com">gopher://supakeen.com</a>. Likely just in time for your browser to not support this protocol anymore.</p>
