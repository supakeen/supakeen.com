        <h1>Pinnwand 1.0.0 and its history</h1>
        <p><a class="reference external" href="https://supakeen.com/project/pinnwand/">pinnwand</a> 1.0.0 was released and shortly thereafter followed by the customary
1.0.1 release to fix that one bug that always gets discovered just after
release. You can download these from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/pinnwand/">PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>The major features that have been added to the pinnwand 1.0 release are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>multi-file pastes, pastes can now contain multiple files</li>
<li>shorter URLs, paste IDs are now more readable and less typo prone</li>
<li>pinnwand was fully rewritten for Python 3 in the <a class="reference external" href="https://tornadoweb.org/">Tornado</a> framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with a slew of smaller changes and bugfixes.</p>
<div class="section" id="history">
<h2>history</h2>
<p>I've been asked before to clarify on the history of the pastebin and how it
came to be. This section of the blog post will go into that.</p>
<p>Back when <a class="reference external" href="https://bpython-interpreter.org/">bpython</a> was started I was one of its contributors (still am) on a
different nickname. I thought it would be neat if we would add pastebin support
to bpython but to do so I didn't want to be reliant on a 3rd party pastebin.</p>
<p>Back in those days there was another pastebin called LodgeIt, it was ran by the
people behind <a class="reference external" href="https://pocoo.org/">Pocoo</a> and built on the <a class="reference external" href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> framework. I setup my own instance
of this on the <a class="reference external" href="https://bpaste.net/">bpaste.net</a> domain. That name came from the bpython name.</p>
<p>After a while some features (I don't exactly recall which) needed to be added
to bpaste.net and I decided to fork LodgeIt and named it pinnwand. That means
&quot;bulletin board&quot; in English and was fitting for a thing that people put stuff
on for others to see.</p>
<p>In keeping with the theme my other projects that involve pinnwand are named
in similar vein: <a class="reference external" href="https://supakeen.com/project/steck/">steck</a> (to stick) a client for sticking stuff on the pinnwand
and <a class="reference external" href="https://supakeen.com/project/nagel/">nagel</a> (a thumbtack) as the library to interface with the pinnwand.</p>
<p>This fork then went on to be hosted at both bpaste.net and on a separate domain
for the #python channel on Freenode. Someone else maintained that instance of
pinnwand. The pastebin recommended in the channel flip flopped between the
channel instance and bpaste.net.</p>
<p>A few years later I rekindled my love for the project and decided to start from
scratch. With this a lot of history was lost but here we are at version 1.0.0
and here to stay!</p>
