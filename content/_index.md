Hey, I enjoy programming, metalworks (mostly welding), cooking, and some other things but mostly the first two are shared here. My nickname is **supakeen** but people also know me as **Simon de Vlieger**. I work at Red Hat on the Image Builder team and related projects. I am a packager for Fedora and contribute to various upstream projects including my own.

## nickname

The nickname _supakeen_ is a combination of two names: Commander Keen and Supaplex. Both were games I played a bunch when I was tiny.

## index

- [homepage](/) the current page
- [weblog](/weblog) about tech and this website

## external

I maintain a bunch of external accounts as well, these are my most used thought that doesn't mean I'm particularly active on them.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/supakeen) my code

## my projects

Some of my open source projects both in software and hardware. I program mostly in the Python programming language, C, bash, and others.

- [steck](https://github.com/supakeen/steck) a client for pinnwand in Python.
- [gb](https://github.com/gopherball) a gopher server in Python

## other projects

These are projects I regularly contribute to but were not started by myself.

## resume

I provide an [anonymized version of my resume](/resume/anonymous.pdf) online, if you are interested in the non-anonymized version you can email me at [cmdr@supakeen.com](mailto:cmdr@supakeen.com).
